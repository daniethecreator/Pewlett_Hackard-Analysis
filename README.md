# Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis <br />

## Overview of the analysis: <br />

The purpose of this analysis was to gather collect information on employees that may soon retire and identify employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help prepare Pewlett Hackard for positions that will need to be filled as soon as current employees reach retirement age. <br />

## Results:
Overall, Pewlett Hackard will need to prepare for 90,398 employees retiring with the majority of them in a Senior Engineer or Senior Staff position. The two departments that will have the greatest impact from employees retiring are Development and Production with each having over 20,000 potential roles to fill. There are under 2,000 eligible Employee Mentors which means even if every mentor that was elibile agreed to be one, they would each have to take over 55 menteess to prepare future employees for all the open positions.   <br />

## Summary: 

  * How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? <br />
      * Over 90,000 roles will be potentially need to be filled as the "silver tsunami begins to make an impact. Although this number seems daunting it should be noted that all employees that can retire may not choose to do so and it could be staggard for the next few years to come depending on each employees' financial situation and personal preference to continue to work or retire.    
      
  
  * Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? <br />
     * No, the available mentors will not compare to the retirement-ready employees as shown by looking at either by title or by department. The good news is that for the most part that even though there is a disparity between the two, the greatest number of eligible mentors is also the same top two title/department for retirees, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff for the top two titles and Development and Production for the top two Departments. After comparing the retireers to the mentors it may be best to either look for outstide talent to supplement promoting from within and maybe even look to some restructuring of the organization to see if there are positions that could be eliminated to make the company leaner. Next steps could be looking at senior responsiblities to see if there are any overlaps on productivity or among departments that could be reassigned.
