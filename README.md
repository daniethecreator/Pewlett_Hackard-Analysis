# Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis <br />

## Overview of the analysis: <br />

The purpose of this analysis was to gather collect information on employees that may soon retire and identify employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help prepare Pewlett Hackard for positions that will need to be filled as soon as current employees reach retirement age. <br />

## Results:
Overall, Pewlett Hackard will need to prepare for 90,398 employees retiring with the majority of them in a Senior Engineer or Senior Staff position. The two departments that will have the greatest impact from employees retiring are Development and Production with each having over 20,000 potential roles to fill. There are only 1,549 eligible Employee Mentors which means even if every mentor that was elibile agreed to be one, they would each have to take on 58 menteess to prepare future employees for all the open positions.   <br />
